        What is ``QSDsan``?
        -------------------
        ``QSDsan`` is an open-source, community-led platform for quantitative sustainable design of sanitation and resource recovery systems. It leverages the structure and modules developed in the `BioSTEAM <https://github.com/BioSTEAMDevelopmentGroup/biosteam>`_ platform with additional functions tailored to sanitation processes.
        
        As an open-source and impact-driven platform, QSDsan aims to identify configuration combinations, systematically probe interdependencies across technologies, and identify key sensitivities to contextual assumptions through the use of quantitative sustainable design methods (techno-economic analysis and life cycle assessment and under uncertainty). 
        
        All systems developed with ``QSDsan`` are included in the package `exposan <https://github.com/QSD-Group/EXPOsan>`_ - exposition of sanitation and resource recovery systems.
