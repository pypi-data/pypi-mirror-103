Description: "toynn" is a handy Neral Network model builder.
        
        You'll be able to create a model in the desired structure with a single line of code.
        Easily train, predict and visualize your model. 
        
        "toynn" supports 'export' and 'import' of models in 'json' format.
        
        Simple example for usage is like below.
        =======================================================================
        import toynn
        
        #build a model
        model = toynn.model.ANN(input_shape=(1, 784), shape = (100, 100, 100, 10), output="softmax", activation=("relu", "relu", "relu"))
        model.describe()
        
        #train
        model.train(y= TRAIN_BATCH, t= ANSWER_BATCH, learning_rate=0.001, iteration=1000)
        
        #predict
        model.predict(x = INPUT)
        
        #export model as a 'json' file to a local directory
        model.export(directory = "C:\Users.......//", file_name="myModel.json")
        
        #import model from a local directory
        factory = toynn.factory.factory()
        model2 = factory.make(directory = "C:\User.....\myModel.json")
        
        =======================================================================
        
        Updates on more types of model such as 'CNN', 'LSTM' is planned.
