    "This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates how to use the crime data analysis module produced by RTNL to identify crime hotspots in UK constituincies. It is an early beta version of the module so there are many missing features. To suggest new features or to report a bug please create an issue on the github https://github.com/Reclaim-The-Night-Leeds/crime-hotspots-uk.\n",

    "The use of data produced by this program is not necessarily endorsed by RTNL. Using this program does not mean we endorse you, your organisation or your aims. We are more than welcome to recieve requests to collaborate on projects and to spread information if we deem it in line with our aims. To work with us please contact RTNLeeds [at] gmail.com\n",
