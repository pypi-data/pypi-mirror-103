# Libratone Zipp controller library in Python

This aims to control a Libratone Zipp speaker with a Python library usable in Home Assistant.

Install it with `pip install python-libratone-zipp` and use it with ``! 

## Acknowledgment

This work is based on the following:

* The Libratone command list is [coming from this work from Benjamin Hanke](https://www.loxwiki.eu/display/LOX/Libratone+Zipp+WLan+Lautsprecher)
* Entity to use: [Media Player](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/entity/media-player)
* Example of [integrations](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/#media-player):
    * Simple: [Harman Kardon AVR integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/harman_kardon_avr/) which use [this module](https://github.com/Devqon/hkavr)
    * Simple: [Clementine Music Player integration](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/blob/dev/homeassistant/components/clementine/media_player.py) which use [this module]()
    * Async: [Frontier Silicon integration](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/tree/dev/homeassistant/components/frontier_silicon) with [this module](https://github.com/zhelev/python-afsapi/tree/master/afsapi)
    * Async with extended features: [Yamaha integration](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/blob/dev/homeassistant/components/yamaha/) with [this module](https://github.com/wuub/rxv)
