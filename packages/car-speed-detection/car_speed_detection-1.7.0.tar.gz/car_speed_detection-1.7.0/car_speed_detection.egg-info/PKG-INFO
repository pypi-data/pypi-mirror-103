Description: # Camera-based Car Speed Detection for Autonomous Driving
        ![Using our library with optical flow to detect the speed for the car](https://github.com/ShaoChiehLien/Car-Speed-Detection/blob/main/GIFforReadme.gif)
        
        Car-Speed-Detection provides a python library to detect the speed of the driving 
        car itself by the video stream from the dashboard camera installed on the car.
        
        Car-Speed-Detection separates the speed detection process into three steps, 
        preprocessing, training, and speed detection. By using Gunnar-Farneback optical flow
        algorithm along with the pipeline we developed, we are able to extract each frame into
        a small size matrix depends on developers preference. We use the Artifitial Neural 
        Network (ANN) to train our model with the preprocessed matrix acquired from preprocessing
        function. Developers could use the trained model to detect the speed of the car
        at each frame using our speed detection function.
        
        ## Getting Started
        ### Installation
        Car-Speed-Detection is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/car-speed-detection/) and can be
        installed via [`pip`](https://pypi.org/project/pip/). See
        [car-speed-detection.readthedocs.io](https://car-speed-detection.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
        to learn about the API and Q&A of our library.
        
        ```shell
        pip install car-speed-detection
        ```
        
        ### Read, Preprocess, Train, and Detect the Car Speed
        The [Car-Speed-Detection](https://pypi.org/project/car-speed-detection/) library consists of the
        following parts:
        - Read (Read the mp4 video and output each frame into a designated directory)
        - Preprocess (Preprocess each frame and output a feature set for training)
        - Train (Train the model using the feature set and Artifitial Neural Network)
        - Speed Detection (Detect the speed using the model and video)
        
        ## API and Example Code
        Take a look at the [API](https://car-speed-detection.readthedocs.io/en/latest/API.html#) to know more about
        the Application Programming Interface and [Sample](https://car-speed-detection.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Example%20Code.html) for further information on how to use our library.
        
        ## Result
        In our [example code](https://car-speed-detection.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Example%20Code.html), we are able to train the model with MSE error less than 2 using the training video provided by comma.ai. We separate the video into 75% for training and 25% for testing so the result woud
        be fair. The ANN model has also substaintially small amount of parameters (< 45,000), which yeild a lower latency 
        compare to [other solutions](https://ucladatares.medium.com/predicting-speed-from-video-frames-dissecting-the-comma-ai-challenge-5da697b55886).

        ## Acknowledge
        This project is managed by Shao-Chieh Lien, the software architect and student at Purdue University.
        
        This was a senior design project at Purdue University. Christopher Crocker was in charge of generating the training data using Carla simulator that could be seen from
        [this Github repository](https://github.com/CrockerC/carla_recording) and Data Section. Meenakshi was in charge or paper writing and documentation.
