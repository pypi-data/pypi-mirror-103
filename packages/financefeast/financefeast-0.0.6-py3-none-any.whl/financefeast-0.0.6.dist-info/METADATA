# Financefeast

A client library to call the Financefeast API

Note: this is alpha quality code still, the API may change, and things may fall apart while you try it.

# Quick start

## Installation

`financefeast` is available from [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/financefeast/) so you can install it as usual:

```
$ pip install financefeast
```

## Usage
You must supply your client id and client secret. You can do this one of two ways, either when you create an instance of Financefeast by passing
client_id and client_secret as args.
```
client = FinanceFeast(client_id="SOME ID", client_secret="SOME SECRET")
```

*or*

Using environment variables 
```
FF-CLIENT-ID and FF-CLIENT-SECRET
```
and then
```
client = FinanceFeast()
```

### Example
```python
from financefeast import FinanceFeast

client = FinanceFeast(client_id="your_client_id", 
                      client_secret="your_client_secret")
print(client.tickers())
```
