# sorta
Get rid of clutter in your directories. Sorta organizes your files by moving them to different folders based on their filetype and extensions.

We tend to download files on our PC's very often and usually this tends to pile up and before you know it, your downloads folder turns into a messy room. Or, you might just like to be organized and have a nice looking desktop. Sorta will take care of this for you by moving your notes, documents, music, images and videos into categorized folders.

It then takes this a step further by creating subfolders that stores files with the same extension.

## Installation
```bash
$ pip install sorta
```
<br>

### Basic Usage
**Organizes files in your (documents,desktop, and downloads directories) by their filetypes.**
```bash
$ sorta
```
<br>

**Organize files in a single specified directory by their filetype.**
```bash
$ sorta -d /path/to/directory
```
<br>

### By category
By default, sorta groups your files by their filetype. You can also choose to organize them by categories by using the command line flags '**-c**' or '**--category**'. You will have to create your own categories by using the '-ac' or '--addcategory' flags when sorta is first installed. These categories contain keywords or phrases that you would specify (it is best to make them as descriptive as possible so that Sorta can make the correct assignments). If a keyword/phrase was found in a filename, the file will be moved to the corresponding category's folder. Files that did not match any categories will simply be ignored.

<br>

**Organize your files in (documents,desktop and downloads) by category.**
```bash
$ sorta -c
```
<br>

**Organize your files in a specific directory by category.**
```bash
$ sorta -d /path/to/directory -c
```

### Allow sorta to run at intervals
**Note: In order to run Sorta in the background, you'll have to run a daemon command or your system's equivalent with Sorta along with the specified arguments(see below) as the process.**
Here is an example of running Sorta indefinitely, allowing it to clean up your directories periodically every 15 minutes. You can stop this by pressing Ctrl+c.
```bash
$ sorta -b -i 15
```
