deprecations:
  - |
    Using APT keys as list of GnuPG ids (via ``apt_keys`` template override) is
    deprecated since Wallaby release and support for them will be dropped in
    Xena cycle. If you used this in your template overrides then please migrate
    into ``remote_apt_keys`` + entries in ``repos.yaml`` file.
