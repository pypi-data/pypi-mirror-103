Help flag\n2. Verbosity flag\n3. Scripts flag\n4. Names flag\n5. Output Folder flag\n6. Output Format flag\n\n#### Help flag\n\nCalling the program with the _help_-flag is the first thing to do\nwhen being encountered with this program.\nIt outputs a so-called _Usage_-message to the CLI:\n\n```shell script\n$ hifis-surveyval --help\nUsage: hifis-surveyval [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...\n\n  Analyze a given CSV file with a set of independent python scripts.\n\nOptions:\n  -v, --verbose             Enable verbose output. Increase verbosity by\n                            setting this option up to 3 times.  [default: 0]\n\n  -s, --scripts TEXT        Select the folder containing analysis scripts.\n                            [default: scripts]\n\n  -n, --names TEXT          Optionally select the specific script names\n                            contained in the scripts folder (while omitting\n                            file endings) which should be executed.\n\n  -o, --output-folder TEXT  Select the folder to put the generated output like\n                            plots into.  [default: output]\n\n  -f, --output-format TEXT  Designate output format. Supported values are:\n                            SCREEN, PDF, PNG, SVG.  [default: screen]\n\n  --help                    Show this message and exit.\n\nCommands:\n  analyze  Read the given files into global data and metadata objects.\n  version  Get the library version.\n```\n\n#### Verbosity flag\n\nThe _verbosity_-flag can be provided in order to specify the verbosity\nof the output to the CLI.\nThis flag is called `--verbose` or `-v` for short:\n\n```shell script\nhifis-surveyval --verbose <COMMAND>\n```\n```shell script\nhifis-surveyval -v <COMMAND>\n```\n\nThe verbosity of the output can be increased even more \nby duplicating the flag `--verbose` or `-v` up to two times:\n\n```shell script\nhifis-surveyval --verbose --verbose --verbose <COMMAND>\n```\n```shell script\nhifis-surveyval -vvv <COMMAND>\n```\n\n#### Scripts flag\n\nBeside verbosity there is a _scripts_-flag called `--scripts` or \n`-s` for short:\n\n```shell script\nhifis-surveyval --scripts "scripts" <COMMAND>\n```\n```shell script\nhifis-surveyval -s "scripts" <COMMAND>\n```\n\nThis will tell the program in which folder to look for the actual \nanalysis scripts.\nIn case the _scripts_-flag is omitted it defaults to sub-folder `scripts/`.\n\n#### Names flag\n\nThere is also a _names_-flag called `--names` or `-n` for short:\n\n```shell script\nhifis-surveyval --names "example_script_1" --names "example_script_2" <COMMAND>\n```\n```shell script\nhifis-surveyval -n "example_script_1" -n "example_script_2" <COMMAND>\n```\n\nThis will tell the program which scripts in the scripts folder to execute.\nIn case the _names_-flag is omitted it defaults to all scripts in the\nscripts folder.\n\n#### Output Folder flag\n\nThe _output-folder_-flag called `--output-folder` or `-o` for short \nis another option:\n\n```shell script\nhifis-surveyval --output-folder "output" <COMMAND>\n```\n```shell script\nhifis-surveyval -o "output" <COMMAND>\n```\n\nThis will tell the program in which folder to put the generated output \nlike plots into.\nIn case the _output-folder_-flag is omitted it defaults to sub-folder \n`output/`.\n\n#### Output format flag\n\nThe user is also able to let the application know in which output format the\ndiagrams should be generated during the analysis. \nFor this purpose there is a flag called `--output-format` or `-f` for short.\nAllowed values to this flag are the following:\n* SCREEN\n* PDF\n* PNG\n* SVG\n\nOn the CLI the actual call looks like this:\n\n```shell script\nhifis-surveyval --output-format PNG <COMMAND>\n```\n```shell script\nhifis-surveyval -f PNG <COMMAND>\n```\n\n### Commands\n\nThere are two different commands implemented which come with different\nflags and parameters:\n\n1. Command _version_\n2. Command _analyze_\n\n#### Command _version_\n \nThe `version` command outputs the version number of \nthis CLI-program like so:\n\n```shell script\nhifis-surveyval version\n0.0.1\n```\n\n#### Command _analyze_\n\nThe more interesting command is the `analyze` command\nwhich comes with a _metadata_-flag `--metadata` or `-m` for short and \na _data_-parameter.\nIn case the _metadata_-flag is omitted it assumes the following\npath to the metadata file: \n`metadata/HIFIS_Software_Survey_2020_Questions.yml`.\nThe _data_-parameter can _not_ be omitted and need to be given explicitly\nin order to be able to start the analysis.\nThis is an example of how to do the analysis:\n\n```shell script\nhifis-surveyval analyze data/<data_file_name>.csv\n```\n\n## Contribute with Own Analysis Scripts\n\n### Essential Criteria for Developing Own Analysis Scripts\n\nAs you might have read in the previous sections the actual analysis scripts \nreside in a specific folder called `scripts/`.\nAll scripts in that folder will be automatically discovered by the package \n`hifis-surveyval` when running the analysis.\nIn order that the program recognizes the scripts in that folder as\nanalysis scripts they need to fulfil the following two criteria:\n\n1. The filename need to end on `.py`.\n2. The file need to contain a function called `run` without any parameters.\n\n```python\n"""\nA dummy script for testing the function dispatch\n\n.. currentmodule:: hifis_surveyval.scripts.dummy\n.. moduleauthor:: HIFIS Software <software@hifis.net>\n"""\n\ndef run():\n    print("Example Script")\n```\n\nIf both criteria are satisfied the program will execute the `run`-functions\nof the analysis scripts in an arbitrary sequence.\n\n### File-System Structure of Core Component\n\n```shell script\n$ tree hifis_surveyval/\nhifis_surveyval/\n├── answer.py\n├── cli.py\n├── data.py\n├── dispatch.py\n├── globals.py\n├── metadata.py\n├── question.py\n├── settings.py\n└── version.py\n```\n\n### Files and Classes Explained\n\n**ToDo**: This section need to be extended to all files and classes\nfound in package `hifis_surveyval`.\n\n#### Classes to Represent Questions\n\nFile `question.py` contains the following classes:\n- `AbstractQuestion`: Abstract class providing properties of a question \nlike `id` and `text`.\n- `Question`: Non-abstract class inheriting from abstract-base-class\n`AbstractQuestion`. It represents a question with associated answers.\n- `QuestionCollection`: Non-abstract class inheriting from abstract-base-class\n`AbstractQuestion`. It represents a question with associated sub-questions.\n\n#### Class to Represent Answers\n\nFile `answer.py` contains class `Answer`.\nThis class provides properties of an answer like `id` and `text`.\n\n## Resources\n\nBelow are some handy resource links.\n\n* [Project Documentation](TODO)\n* [Click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x) is a Python package for creating beautiful command line interfaces in a composable way with as little code as necessary.\n* [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) is a tool that makes it easy to create intelligent and beautiful documentation, written by Geog Brandl and licnsed under the BSD license.\n* [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) helps you write better programs.\n* [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) is a tool which controls the generation of executables and other non-source files of a program from the program\'s source files.\n\n\n## License\n\nCopyright © 2021 HIFIS Software <support@hifis.net>\n\nThis work is licensed under the following license(s):\n* Everything else is licensed under [GPL-3.0-or-later](LICENSES/GPL-3.0-or-later.txt)\n\nPlease see the individual files for more accurate information.\n\n> **Hint:** We provided the copyright and license information in accordance to the [REUSE Specification 3.0](https://reuse.software/spec/).',
