Description: shrep
        =====
        
        shrep lets you run a shell command repeatedly, or until it fails. It's
        intended for diagnosing intermittent failures -- e.g. say you have a C
        program that seg faults once every hundred runs or so, and you need to
        reproduce it to fix it::
        
            shrep -n 100 ./myprog
        
        shrep can also run your program until it fails rather than a fixed
        number of repetitions. It can capture stdout and stderr to avoid
        cluttering your terminal. It can run child processes in parallel. See
        the man page for the full story::
        
            groff -man -Tascii shrep.1 | less
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        shrep is currently a single-file Python script. The easiest way to
        install it is::
        
            pip install --user shrep
        
        That will put the executable in ``~/.local/bin``.
        
        It also installs a man page, which you can read with ::
        
            MANPATH=~/.local/share/man man shrep
        
        (At least, that works for me on Ubuntu.)
