This is a multi-functional statistical package that can be used for sets of data that  are described by Gaussian or Binomial distributions. The package can read a data file and calculate the pertinent quantities for these kinds of distributions such as the mean and the standard deviation for the Gaussian and Binomial distributions. It can also calculate the probability and size of a distribution for a set of data described by a binomial distribution. The package also can create a bar-graph visualization with labeled axis's for the data set. The user should know how to use class functions. 

To use the package in your terminal type:

cd Binom_&_Gauss
pip install .

Once that is complete the package can be used, for example:

guassian_one = Gaussian(25, 2)
