        Demo
        ====
        
        The driver instances of selenium and appium must be transferred by a
        fixture.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            import pytest
            from selenium import webdriver
        
        
            @pytest.fixture()
            def init_driver():
                driver = webdriver.Chrome()
                yield driver
                driver.close()
                driver.quit()
        
        
            def test_login_success(init_driver):
                init_driver.get("https://github.com/fungaegis/pytest-failed-screenshot")
                assert False
        
        
            # helium demo
            @pytest.fixture()
            def init_helium():
                yield None
                kill_browser()
        
        
            @pytest.mark.usefixtures("init_helium")
            def test_helium_demo():
                start_chrome("https://github.com/fungaegis/pytest-failed-screenshot")
                # The webdriver process cannot be killed within a use case
                assert False
