	Docstring for function pyKrev.kendrick_mass_defect
	====================
	This function takes a list of molecular formula and their corresponding mz_values and calculates kendrick mass defect scores.  
    
	Use
	----
	kendrick_mass_defect(Y,X)
    
	Returns a tuple contains two numpy arrays of len(Y). The first contains the kendrickMass and the second contains the kendrickMassDefect.
    
	Parameters
	----------
	Y: A list of molecular formula. 
    X: A list of mz_values of len(Y). 
    
    base: Atom group used to define the Kendrick mass.
    rounding: The method of rounding to use when calculating kendrick mass defect. One of 
        - even: for values exactly halfway between rounded decimal values, numpy rounds to the nearest even value. 
                Thus 1.5 and 2.5 round to 2.0, -0.5 and 0.5 round to 0.0, etc.
        - integer: for values exactly halfway between rounded decimal values, numpy rounds up to the nearest integer value. 
                Thus 1.5 becomes 2.0, 2.5 becomes 3.0 
    Info
	----------
    Calculation taken from Hughey et al (2001) 
    "Kendrick Mass Defect Spectrum: A Compact Visual Analysis for Ultrahigh-Resolution Broadband Mass Spectra"
    Note: Rounding calculations may lead to "edge effects" in complex datasets with many peaks. 
    We recommend experimenting with both even and integer rounding methods when making kmd plots.
