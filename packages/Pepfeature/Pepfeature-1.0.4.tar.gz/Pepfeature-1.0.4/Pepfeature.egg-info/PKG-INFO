        ## What is it
        
        **pepfeature** is a Python package providing fast and flexible algorithms and functions
        for the feature calculation of epitope features which can be used for macine learning purposes such as classification for epitiope prediction.
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        [Documentation underconstruction]
        
        Download pepfeature folder from this repo. You can use the pepfeature/examples.py script as a playing field.
        
        Make sure you have the modules pandas and numpy installed.
        
        (Tested on python 3.8)
        
        ## How to use it
        
        Ensure that any lines of code that utilize this package are encapsulated within the code block:
        if __name__ == '__main__':
        
        Please see pepfeature/examples.py for example use cases.
        
        Also see the attached API of each function/ algorithm, for a complete documentation.
