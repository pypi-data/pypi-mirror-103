Description: # Pepfeature
        ### _A package that consists of functions for calculating epitope/peptide features for prediction purposes_
        
        
        
        ### What is it
        
        **Pepfeature** is a Python package providing routines for calculating peptide features on a given amino acid sequence.
        These features can be used for macine learning purposes such as classification for epitiope prediction.
        
        ## Pepfeature Requirements
        **Required Software/Tools:**  
        - Python 3.8
        
        **Required Package Dependencies:**  
        - panadas
        - numpy
        - setuptools
        - openpyxl
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```
        pip install Pepfeature
        ```
        (All missing dependancies are expected to be installed asswell with this 'pip install'.)
        The source code is currently hosted on GitHub at: https://github.com/essakh/pepfeature
        
        ## Example Use
        **NOTE: The Github contains an 'examples.py' with many example use cases**
        
        Example:
        ```python
        import pepfeature as pep
        import pandas
        
        df = pd.read_csv('pepfeature/data/Sample_Data.csv')
        
        #Use of pepfeature
        if __name__ == '__main__':
            #Calculate all features on df
            df_feat = pep.aa_all_feat.calc_df(dataframe=df, aa_column='Info_window_seq', Ncores=4, k=2)
         
            print(df_feat)
        ```
        
        
        ## How to use it
        
        **Ensure at all times that any lines of code that utilize this package are encapsulated within the code block.**
        ```python
        if __name__ == '__main__':
        ```
        
        Please see pepfeature/examples.py for example use cases.
        
        Also see the attached API of each function/ algorithm, for a complete documentation.
