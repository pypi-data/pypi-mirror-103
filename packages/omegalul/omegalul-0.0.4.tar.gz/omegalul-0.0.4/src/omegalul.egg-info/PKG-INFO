Description: # omegalul
        A Python library for building omegle clients
        
        # Credits
        This library is mostly based on [nucular's omegle reverse engineering gist](https://gist.github.com/nucular/e19264af8d7fc8a26ece)
        
        # Usage
        Right now, Omegalul is stateless, there are no classes, you pass your client's ID and your chosen server around
        ```python3
        # get status and choose a random server
        status = omegalul.fetch_status()
        server = omegalul.get_random_server(status['servers'])
        
        # start a chat and get your client's ID
        chat = omegalul.start_chat(server)
        id = chat['clientID']
        
        while True:
            events = omegalul.fetch_events(server, id)
            print(events)
        ```
