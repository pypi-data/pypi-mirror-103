    Detect features using difference of Gaussians.
    
    Arguments:
        image_in (2D array): The input, grayscale image, the features are assumed to be light on dark background (white on black). \n
        min_sigma (float): The minimum standard deviation for Gaussian kernel. Reduce to detect smaller features. \n
        max_sigma (float): The maximum standard deviation for Gaussian kernel. Increase to detect larger features. \n
        sigma_ratio (float): The ratio between the standard deviation of Gaussian kernels used for computing the difference of Gaussians. \n
        threshold (float): The absolute lower bound for scale space maxima. Local maxima smaller than threshold are ignored. Reduce to detect blobs with less intensities. \n
        overlap (float): A value between 0 and 1. If the area of two features overlaps by a fraction greater than threshold, the smaller feature is eliminated. \n
    Returns:
        features (pandas DataFrame): A pandas DataFrame with the detected features. \n
        image_out (2D array): The output image.
