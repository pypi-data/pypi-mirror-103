# XDATA
a easy to use database,that is better,faster,more intuitive,EASY than any other database out there


This handy tool is meant for pure databasing, go to main.py for an example of most of the commands


if you want to have 1 entry only,and delete system we would recommend using store_new_content, but if you want to make it so that once the code is done
to just repeat the system on the next line use add_content

we do not recommend opening DATAX_API_FILES directory(folder) manualy,as this gives higher chance of file corruption,instead use show_content("FILENAME") for the system to open it.


FOLDER IS ONLY COMPATIBLE WITH TXT EDITION JSON EDITION COMING OUT SOON

Beta json edition:
example in mainj.py
is reciving updates soon,not recommended for commercial YET.Will be soon though.
