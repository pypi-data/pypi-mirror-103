Description: 
        **XpGraph** is a Python3 package for explaining graph-based classifiers:
        Binary decision diagrams (BDDs), Multi-valued decision diagrams (MDDs), 
        Decision Tree (DTs), Decision Graph (DGs). 
        Additionally, it contains an executable `XpG.py`, which can be applied 
        for computing one Abductive explanation (`AXp`, or PI-explanation), one Contrastive
        explanation (`CXp`) or enumerating all explanations (AXps and CXps) of a given 
        `.xpg` file input.
