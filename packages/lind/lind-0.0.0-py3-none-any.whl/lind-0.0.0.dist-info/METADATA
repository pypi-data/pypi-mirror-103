Description: # Lind
        
        This package is meant to house common tools used in experiments design and
        analysis. There is little "novel" functionality here, but it is hopefully
        packaged in a way that is convenient and useful for users.
        
        I began this package for two reasons. First, I was  dissatisfied with the
        existing packages available for experimentation in python. They seemed like
        collections of random tools rather than a cohesive set of utilities that work
        together in harmony to a united purpose. Second, I used this as an opportunity
        to refresh my understanding of various statistical tools and methods.

        ### About the Name
        
        Looking for a name for this package I tried looking back into the history of
        experimentation. I was tempted to name the package after King Nebuchadnezzar in
        reference to the "legumes and water" anecdote from the book of Daniel. This is
        often considered one of the earliest controlled "trials".
        
        However, some of the first modern controlled trials were conducted by Dr. James
        Lind. There are many scatter references to trials throughout history, but Lind
        represented the start of the modern era of controlled trials and their
        integration into the scientific method. Hence I named the package after Lind.
        If you  have a chance, I recommend taking an afternoon and reading about the
        work Lind did to fight the disease Scurvy.
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your
        local machine for development and testing purposes.
        
        ### Installing
        
        For a local installation, first git clone this repository. Then follow these
        instructions:
        
        ```
        pip install .
        ```
        
        To install from [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/lind/):
        
        ```
        pip install lind
        ```
        
        To install the package with test dependencies add `[tests]` to the install
        command:
        
        ```
        pip install lind[tests]
        ```
        
        To install with test dependencies and R backends:
        
        ```
        pip install -U "lind[tests, r_backends]"
        ```
        
        Some functionality requires pre-computed designs available as static files. To
        install with static file support:
        
        ```
        pip install -U "lind[tests, r_backends, static_designs]"
        ```
        
        ### R Backends
        
        Many of the best experiment design packages are written in R due to the
        language's popularity in academia. However, R is not always a convenient
        language to work with (especially for industry practitioners). If you install
        lind with the `r_backends` extra requirement, you will get access to additional
        functionality drawing from popular R experimental design package. The default
        installation relies only on python native code.
        
        **Warning:** We have chosen respected and reputable R packages to use as our
        backend where R code is used. However, code quality and accuracy of backend
        R code is not tested in this package. Please see the documentation for those
        packages to learn more about them. R package name are documented in the
        appropriate module docstrings.
        
        ### Quick Start
        
        TODO
        
        ## Testing
        
        Testing is an important part of creating maintainable, production grade code.
        Below are instructions for running unit and style tests as well as installing
        the necessary testing packages. Tests have intentionally been separated from
        the installable pypi package for a variety of reasons.
        
        Make sure you have the required testing packages:
        
        ```
        pip install -r requirements_test.txt
        ```
        
        To install the project  with test dependencies see the install section.
        
        ### Running the unit tests
        
        We use the pytest framework for unit testing. Test preset args are defined
        in `pytest.ini`.
        
        ```
        pytest
        ```
        
        We aspire to no lower than 80% code coverage for unit tests.
        
        ### Running the style tests
        
        Having neat and legible code is important. Having documentation is also
        important. We use pylint as our style guide framework. Many of our naming
        conventions follow directly from the literary sources they come from. This
        makes it easier to read the mathematical equations and see how they translate
        into the code. This sometimes forces us to break pep8 conventions for naming.
        Linting presets are defined in pylintrc.
        
        ```
        pylint lind
        ```
        
        We aspire to no lower than an 8.0 / 10.0 style score when linting.
        
        ## Contributor's Guide
        
        Here are some basic guidelines for contributing.
        
        ### Branch Strategy
        
        This repository doesn't use a complicated branching strategy. Simply create a
        feature branch off of master. When the feature is ready to be integrated with
        master, submit a pull request. A pull request will re quire at least one peer
        review and approval from the repository owner.
        
        ### Style Guide
        
        Please stick to pep8 standards when for your code. Use numpy style docstrings.
        
        ### Test Requirements
        
        Please use pytest as your testing suite. You code should have >= 80% coverage.
        
        ### Updating the Docs
        
        Updating the documentation is simple. First, let auto-docs check for updates to
        the package structure.
        
        ```
        cd docs
        make html
        ```
        
        ## Acknowledgments
        
        A big thanks to Mack Sweeney, Tom Caputo, and Matt Van Adlesberg, each of which
        has put up with my many questions about experimental design and analysis. A
        special thanks to Mack Sweeney who continues to challenge me to become a better
        software engineer.
        
        ## TODO
        
        1. Install R in docker containers
        
        ## Useful Resources
        
        Many of the best packages for experimental design are written in R. The link
