HydroMT: Build and analyze models like a data-wizard
====================================================

Spatial environmental models (such as hydrology, hydrodynamic, groundwater, flooding, water quality and water demand), 
generally require lot's of data and data manipulations to set up. Then, once you have model results you'd like to analyze 
these and make nice graphics. This package aims to facilitate the processes of building 
a model input data, connecting models and analyzing model output data based on the state of the art 
scientific python ecosystem. Using this package every modeller will become a true data wizard.

HydroMT is part of the Model Builder Engine of Deltares |BlueEarth|


Latest applications with HydroMT
================================

- Coumpound flooding in Mozambique
- Water quality diagnostic in Peru
- National hydrologic models for Indonesia
