--------------
You can install PyDrive with regular pip command.
```python
pip install pygdrive
```
You can install pygdrive from the current development version from GitHub, use:

```python
pip install git+https://github.com/vectorspace-ai/pygdrive.git
```

Creating credentials.json file
---------------------------

Download client_secrets.json from Google API Console. 
Share your Drive account's folder to your service account.
Your service account's addresss looks like XXX@XXX.iam.gserviceaccount.com.
Then your service account can see the shared folder from your Drive account.

Ð¡reating Gdrive object
---------------

```python
  from pygdrive import Gdrive
  SCOPES = ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive']
  CREDENTIALS_FILEPATH = 'credentials.json'
  DOWNLOAD_DIR = 'download_dir/'
  UPLOAD_DIR = 'upload_dir/'
  gdrive_object = Gdrive(CREDENTIALS_FILEPATH, SCOPES, DOWNLOAD_DIR, UPLOAD_DIR)
  ```

File management made easy
-------------------------

Upload file to certain folder:

Make sure that folder exists and filename appears in UPLOAD_DIR

```python   
folder_id, _ = gdrive_object.find_folder('coingecko')
gdrive_object.upload_file(folder_id, 'filename.extension')
```

You could specify your local upload path if it differs from UPLOAD_DIR:

```python   
folder_id, _ = gdrive_object.find_folder('coingecko')
gdrive_object.upload_file(folder_id, 'filename.extension', 'upload_storage/')
```

Create folder:

```python   
parent_id = 'PARENT ID'
folder_id = gdrive_object.create_folder(parent_id, 'folder_name')
```

Make sure that DOWNLOAD_DIR exists and filename.extension in google drive folder. 

```python
file_id, file_name = gdrive_object.find_file('filename.extension')
gdrive_object.download_file(file_id, file_name)
```

You could specify your local download path if it differs from DOWNLOAD_DIR:

```python   
file_id, file_name = gdrive_object.find_file('filename.extension')
gdrive_object.download_file(file_id, file_name, 'some_updated_local_path/')
```

After uploading/downloading files you should expect uploaded/downloaded file.
