Description: # tessToPy
        ## Overview
        tessToPy is a python package for representing a tessellated structure generated by Neper (https://neper.info/). This tessellation representation can be combined with a python representation of the discretized structure and used to write input files for finite element analysis (FEA). The primary function of the code is to regularize a periodic tessellation. The regularization tries to remove short edges from the structure, as short edges could be detremental to the overall quality of a FEA mesh. 
        
        A unregularized and regularized tessellation is shown below:

        The effect of regularization on the edge length distribution in a 400 cell tessellation is shown  below:

        ## Getting started
        This package can be installed with 
        ```
        $ pip install tessToPy
        ```
        
        The tessellation is loaded as an object by
        
        ```
        tess = tessToPy.PeriodicTesselation(tessellation.tess)
        ```
        The tessellation is regularized by 
        
        ```
        tess.regularize(n=len(tess.edges))
        ```
        and can be written to a condensed .tess file by
        
        ```
        tess.write(new_file_name)
        ```
        
        The tessellation can also be meshed (with gmsh, must be installed), by calling
        ```
        tess.mesh2D(elem_size)
        ```
        where elem_size is the target length of the elements along an edge. 
        
        The file original_tessellation_processing.py is compatible with the [FoamModeling](https://github.com/DanielThorM/foamModeling) project, which has not been updated. This can be used to generate LS-DYNA input files for modeling foam structures. Please seen *Characterization and modeling of the mechanical behavior of polymer foam* by Daniel Morton for further context.
