# ToDo: Update this module's documentation.
"""This module contains vortex class definitions, and useful aerodynamic functions.

This module contains the following classes:
    LineVortex: This class is used to contain line vortices.

    HorseshoeVortex: This class is used to contain horseshoe vortices.

    RingVortex: This class is used to contain ring vortices.

This module contains the following exceptions:
    None

This module contains the following functions:
    calculate_velocity_induced_by_horseshoe_vortices: This function takes in a group of
    points, and the attributes of a group of horseshoe vortices. At every point,
    it finds the induced velocity due to every horseshoe vortex, which are
    characterized by groups of back right vertices, front right vertices, front left
    vertices, back left vertices, and strengths.

    calculate_velocity_induced_by_ring_vortices: This function takes in a group of
    points, and the attributes of a group of ring vortices. At every point, it finds
    the induced velocity due to every ring vortex, which are characterized by groups
    of back right vertices, front right vertices, front left vertices, back left
    vertices, and strengths.

    calculate_velocity_induced_by_line_vortices: This function takes in a group of
    points, and the attributes of a group of line vortices. At every point, it finds
    the induced velocity due to every line vortex, which are characterized by groups
    of origins, terminations, and strengths.

    numba_subtract: This function takes in two arrays, one containing N vectors of 3
    components, and one containing M vectors of 3 components. The function then
    calculates and returns a matrix containing the vectors that go from each of the N
    vectors to each of the M vectors.

    numba_explicit_norm: This function takes in an array of shape (M x N x 3),
    which represents M x N vectors, each having 3 components. The function calculates
    and returns the lengths of each vector.
    
    numba_2d_explicit_cross: This function takes in two arrays, which each contain N 
    x M vectors of 3 components. The function then calculates and returns the cross 
    product of the two vectors at each position.

    numba_vector_absolute_magnitude: This function takes in an array of floats which
    is of size (M x N x 3). This represents N x M vectors, each with 3 components.
    The function then calculates and returns the vector absolute magnitude, which is
    the sum of the square of each component.

    numba_discard_singularities: This function takes in an 3d array and replaces any
    inf or nan values with float 0s.

    numba_compute_k_constants: This is a helper function which computes the k
    constants used by the calculate_velocity_induced_by_line_vortices function.

    numba_compute_dot_constants: This function computes the constants used by the
    calculate_velocity_induced_by_line_vortices function that are related to the dot
    product.

    numba_collapse: This function is a helper for the
    calculate_velocity_induced_by_line_vortices function. It uses Numba to speed up
    the summed effects from each of the M line vortices on each of the N points.
