Description: thomas-jupyter-widget
        =====================
        
        Widget to display and interact with Bayesian Networks in JupyterLab. This version only supports JupyterLab >= 3.
        
        Regular Installation
        --------------------
        The package can be installed through `pip`:
        ```bash
        pip install thomas-jupyter-widget
        ```
        
        
        Development Installation
        ------------------------
        First ensure that `nodejs` (>=12) and `yarn` are installed. In debian, you can use the following if you have `sudo` privileges:
        ```bash
        curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo bash -
        
        # Running apt-get update is not necessary, since it's alread called in the
        # above setup script.
        sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
        
        # Install yarn properly. The version of yarn that's available by default is
        # just weird.
        sudo apt-get remove cmdtest
        sudo npm install --global yarn
        ```
        
        Second, depending on your situation, you may want to create a virtual environment. For example, this might be useful if the command `jupyter labextension develop --overwrite .` fails because it cannot write to the system-wide extensions folder (e.g. `/usr/local`). Under debian/ubuntu, a virtual environment can be created as follows:
        ```bash
        # Install the virtualenv package to make life easier
        pip install virtualenv
        
        # Create a virtual environment in the subdirectory '.venv'
        virtualenv .venv
        
        # Activate the virtual environment.
        source .venv/bin/activate
        ```
        
        After the preliminaries, install the package as follows:
        
        ```bash
        # Clone the repository and move into the directory
        git clone https://github.com/mellesies/thomas-jupyter-widget.git
        cd thomas-jupyter-widget
        
        # Checkout branch jupyter3
        git checkout jupyter3
        
        # Install the package in editable mode.
        pip install -e .
        
        # We need the latest version of JupyterLab, otherwise this will fail
        pip install git+https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab
        
        # link your development version of the extension with JupyterLab
        jupyter labextension develop --overwrite .
        
        # watch the source directory, automatically rebuilding when needed
        yarn --cwd ./js run watch
        ```
        
        Then, start JupyterLab like you normally would in a separate terminal (and don't forget to activate the virtual environment if you're using one ;-).
