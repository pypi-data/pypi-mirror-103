class FPI:
    '''FPI is a modern voxel-based tracer-location algorithm that can reliably
    work with unknown numbers of tracers in fast and noisy environments.

    It was successfully used to track fast-moving radioactive tracers in pipe
    flows at the Virginia Commonwealth University. If you use this algorithm in
    your work, please cite the following paper:

        Wiggins C, Santos R, Ruggles A. A feature point identification method
        for positron emission particle tracking with multiple tracers. Nuclear

        843:22-8.

    Permission was granted explicitly by Dr. Cody Wiggins in March 2021 to
    publish his code in the `pept` library under the GNU v3.0 license.

    Two main methods are provided: `fit_sample` for tracking a single voxel
    space (i.e. a single `pept.Voxels`) and `fit` which tracks all the samples
    encapsulated in a `pept.VoxelData` class *in parallel*.

    Attributes
    ----------
    w: double
        Search range to be used in local maxima calculation. Typical values for
        w are 2 - 5 (lower number for more particles or smaller particle
        separation).

    r: double
        Fraction of peak value used as threshold. Typical values for r are
        usually between 0.3 and 0.6 (lower for more particles, higher for
        greater background noise)

    lld_counts: double, default 0
        A secondary lld to prevent assigning local maxima to voxels with very
        low values. The parameter lld_counts is not used much in practice -
        for most cases, it can be set to zero.

    Methods
    -------
    fit_sample(voxels, as_array = False, verbose = False)
        Use the FPI algorithm to locate a tracer from a single voxellised
        space (i.e. from one sample of LoRs).

    fit(voxel_data, max_workers = None, verbose = True)
        Fit multiple voxellised samples of LoRs (in an instance of
        `pept.VoxelData`) and return the tracked tracer locations.

    Examples
    --------
    A typical workflow would involve reading LoRs from a file, creating a lazy
    `VoxelData` voxellised representation, instantiating an `FPI` class,
    tracking the tracer locations from the LoRs, and plotting them.

    >>> import pept
    >>> from pept.tracking.fpi import FPI

    >>> lors = pept.LineData(...)   # set sample_size and overlap appropriately
    >>> voxels = pept.VoxelData(lors)

    >>> fpi = FPI(w = 3, r = 0.4)
    >>> positions = fpi.fit(voxels) # this is a `pept.PointData` instance

    >>> grapher = PlotlyGrapher()
    >>> grapher.add_points(positions)
    >>> grapher.show()

        method before calling this function.

        Parameters
        ----------
        voxels: pept.Voxels
            A single voxellised space (i.e. from a single sample of LoRs) for
            which the tracers' locations will be found using the FPI method.

        Returns
        -------
        locations: numpy.ndarray or pept.PointData

            returned as a NumPy array with columns [time, x, y, z, error_x,
            error_y, error_z]. If `as_array` is False, the points are returned

        The input `pept.VoxelData` class can voxellise samples of LoRs (from a
        `pept.LineData`) in parallel, *on demand* - that is, the voxels will
        not be stored in memory all at once, only when needed.

        This is a convenience function that asynchronously iterates through the
        samples in a `VoxelData`, finding the tracer locations. For more
        fine-grained control over the tracking, the `fit_sample` method can be
        used for individual samples.

        Parameters
        ----------
        voxel_data: pept.VoxelData
            The voxellised samples of LoRs; the `pept.VoxelData` class can
            compute the voxellisation steps in parallel, *on-demand*,
            minimising the amount of memory needed at once.

        max_workers: int, optional
            The maximum number of threads that will be used for asynchronously
            finding the tracers' positions. If unset (`None`), the maximum
            number of threads available on the machine will be used.

        verbose : bool, default True
