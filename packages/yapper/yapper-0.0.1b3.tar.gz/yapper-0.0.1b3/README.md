# simple-docstring-parser

Super simple python docstring parser

Uses docspec to parse docstrings to markdown.

Intended for use with static site generators where further linting / linking / styling is done downstream.

Loosely based on Numpy-style docstrings.

Automatically infers types from signature typehints. Explicitly documented types are NOT supported in docstrings.
