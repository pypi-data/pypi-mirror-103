Description: # Python Image Utility (pyimgutil)
        
        ## About
        
        This is a simple command-line utility, written in Python, for individual or
        batch image processing.
        
        There are a number of excellent programs out there that already do what this
        program does, but sometimes a quick, lightweight, solution is nice to have
        handy, too.
        
        Current features:
        
        * convert
        * crop
        * resize
        * change image quality
        
        Future features being considered:
        
        * rotate
        * thumbnail
        * transpose
        
        If you find this program useful and you would like a feature sooner or have
        a feature you would like to suggest, see [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) for
        more details.
