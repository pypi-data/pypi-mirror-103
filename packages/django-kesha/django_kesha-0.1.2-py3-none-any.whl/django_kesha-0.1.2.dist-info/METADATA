# kesha

kesha is an accounting helper for django.
It provides the necessary models and view and is ready to be included into your project.

## Idea

I need an accounting tool, but I don't like Gnucash. I want to link documents to each booking,
and the whole thing should be somewhat auditproof. I could not find any tool that suits these
needs, therefore I started writing my own tools. Previously I worked on [kescher](https://github.com/westnetz/kescher) which is the proof of concept for this application. It has some major flaws, (e.g. i does not calculate correctly) but this will be fixed with this app.

## Features

_Django-kesha_ currently provides some basic accounting functionality.
