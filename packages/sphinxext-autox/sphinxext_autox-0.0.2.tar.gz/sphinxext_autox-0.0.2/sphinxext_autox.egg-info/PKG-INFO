Description: # Sphinx-autox
        
        A little opinionated version of autodoc and autosummary that
        recursively documents your modules and creates one file per class.
        
        ## Usage
        
        Add `sphinxext_autox` as the **first** entry to your extensions in `conf.py`:
        
        ```py
        extensions = [
            'sphinxext_autox',
            ...
        ]
        ```
        
        Create a `api.rst` file like the following:
        
        ```rst
        My API
        ======
        
        .. autosummary::
           :toctree: source
           :recursive:
        
           mymodule1
           mymodule2
        ```
        
        The stub files will be created/maintained in the `source` folder.
        
        ## Critique
        
        Unfortunately, since other files in Sphinx also try to load autodoc,
        this package has to replace the original files. It isn't possible to
        make a custom version without also having to change the rST tags.
