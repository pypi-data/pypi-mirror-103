# number-factorization-diagrams
## Description
Factorization diagrams are depictions of numbers using dots but grouped by factors. They were invented by PhD student Brent Yorgey. 

This visualization helps us track the prime factors that compose a given number. We can easily identify primes when we arrive to a
simple circle (i.e. a prime cannot be composed of smaller divisors). We can also identify common patterns of smaller prime divisors
e.g. `2`, `3`, `5`
