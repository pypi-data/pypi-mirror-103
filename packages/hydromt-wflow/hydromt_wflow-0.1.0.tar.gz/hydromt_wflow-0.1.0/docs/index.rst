=====================
HydroMT plugin: wflow
=====================

`HydroMT <https://github.com/Deltares/hydromt>`_ is a python package, developed by Deltares, to build 
and analyse environmental models. It provides a generic model api with attributes to access the model schematization, 
(dynamic) forcing data, results and states. This plugin provides an implementation for the 
`wflow <https://github.com/Deltares/Wflow.jl>`_ package. It details the different steps and explains how to 
use HydroMT to easily get started and work on your own wflow model.

For detailed information on HydroMT itself, you can visit the `core documentation <https://hydromt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
