5 functions to calculate age related parameters
 - decimal_age: returns a decimal age from 2 dates (birth_date and observation_date) and gestational age at delivery (gestation_weeks and gestation_days), based on 40 weeks as 0. Days/Weeks before 40 weeks are negative.
 - chronological_decimal_age: returns a decimal age from 2 dates (takes birth_date and observation_date)
 - corrected_decimal_age: returns a corrected decimal age accounting for prematurity (takes birth_date: date, observation_date: date, gestation_weeks: int, gestation_days: int, pregnancy_length_day [optional])
 - chronological_calendar_age: returns a calendar age as a string (takes birth_date or estimated_date_delivery and observation_date)
 - estimated_date_delivery: returns estimated date of delivery in a known premature infant (takes birth_date, gestation_weeks, gestation_days, pregnancy_length_days[optional])
