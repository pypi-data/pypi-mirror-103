## Alpha Development Status

The current development state of this project is *alpha*. Towards the beta

- naming of modules, classes and methods will change, since the final wording is not
  done.
- Code inspections are not finished.
- The documentation is broad or incomplete.
- Testing is not complete, as it is added during the first test phase. At this
  state mostly doctests are applied at class or function level.
