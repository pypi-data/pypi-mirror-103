        ## Alpha Development Status
        
        The current development state of this project is *alpha*. Towards the beta
        
        - naming of modules, classes and methods will change, since the final wording is not
          done.
        - Code inspections are not finished.
        - The documentation is broad or incomplete.
        - Testing is not complete, as it is added during the first test phase. At this
          state mostly doctests are applied at class or function level.
