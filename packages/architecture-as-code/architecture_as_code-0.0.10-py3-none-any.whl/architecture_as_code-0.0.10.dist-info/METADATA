# Architecture as Code

## Standardise and speed up application architecture and deployments

Architecture as Code is a Python package that allows you to standardised and speed up your application architecture and deployments.

Improve time-to-market.

It requires Python 3.6 or higher, check your Python version first.

It uses [Graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/) (via [Diagrams](https://diagrams.mingrammer.com/)) to render the diagram, so you first need to install Graphviz before using this package.
