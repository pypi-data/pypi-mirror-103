Description: ## LCExtract
        ### Quickstart
        To run application from python console 
        >`from LCExtract.LCExtract import LCExtract`
        > 
        >`LCExtract()`
        ### Description
        Currently a standalone application written in **Python** to take astronomical object positions and search for photometry 
        data over time which produces a _lightcurve_ for the object.
        
        Queries data from [Panoramic Survey Telescope And Rapid Response System](https://panstarrs.ifa.hawaii.edu/pswww/) 
        (Pan-STARRS) DR2 as hosted at the [Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes](https://archive.stsci.edu) (MAST),
        [Palomar Transient Factory](https://www.ptf.caltech.edu) (PTF) and the 
        [Zwicky Transient Facility](https://www.ztf.caltech.edu) (ZTF), the latter of which are hosted at
        [NASA/IPAC Infrared Science Archive](https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/frontpage/) (IRSA). Other time domain based facilities will be added in 
        to the query over time to provide a more comprehensive history of the object's luminosity variation.
        
        Options selectable by the user are
        * File or Manual entry
          * File input requires `name`, `RA`, `DEC`, `description` CSV separation - see example file [test_objects.csv](https://github.com/Pommers/LCExtract/blob/master/data/test_objects.csv)
          * Manual entry allows named or positional coordinate entry
        * Archive / Catalog 
          * Pan-STARRS
          * PTF 
          * ZTF
          * All - consolidate data from facilities
        * Photometric filter selection
          * Filters `g`, `r`, `i`, `z`, `y`, `R` are default filters, but note
            * a subset is user-selectable
            * not all filters available within archive(s), e.g., ZTF uses only `g`, `r`, `i` filters
            * not all filters available for an object
        
        Application will calculate a number of summary statistics from the data returned for an object and provide a plot of any archive data returned.
        ### Data files
        Data files are expected to be located in the working directory, preferably under a subdirectory `data/`
