Description: # bingwall
        bing.com change it wallpaper every day and it allways is too beauty so i wrote a simple script with python to download them.
        
        ##### this script is wrote just for fun for any OS. such as Gnu/Linux, Windows, Android, etc
        
        i tryed program under ["Ubuntu", "Android"] with python3. it's work prefectly.
        if there is any bug or suggest you can fix it by your self or tel me.
        
        ### if you are in linux base:
        you can soft link this script to `/etc/cron.daily` so then you can have daily wallpaper of [bing](https://www.bing.com).
        
        and if you don't like auto run, you can soft link it to `~/.local/bin`
        
        ### or if you have android, you sould use _termux_
        
        ### and if you are using windows:
        you can use *windows task scheduler* to download daily wallpaper.
        
        or you can run it manualy
