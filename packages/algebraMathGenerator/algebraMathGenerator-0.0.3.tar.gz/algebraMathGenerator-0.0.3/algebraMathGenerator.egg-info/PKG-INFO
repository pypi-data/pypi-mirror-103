Description: Algebra generator that can easily create algebra equations in the Ax + b = C format. It can also solve equations in Ax + b = C. Right now, only the operations, '-' and '+' are supported
        
        # Getting Started
        The following is an example of how to create a algebra math equation.
        The `algebraMathGenerator.generateAlgebraEquation()` will return a class, so you can get the equation by adding a `.equation` after it.
        
        
        ```py
        import algebraMathGenerator
        
        equationClass = algebraMathGenerator.generateAlgebraEquation(operation = "+")
        print(equationType.equation)
        
        ```
        
        You can solve equations with `algebraMathGenerator.solveAlgebraEquation(equation : class)`. The equation variable should be a class returned from `algebraMathGenerator.generateAlgebraEquation()`
        
        ```py
        import algebraMathGenerator
        
        equationClass = algebraMathGenerator.generateAlgebraEquation(operation = "+")
        answer = algebraMathGenerator.solveAlgebraEquation(equationType)
        print(equationClass.equation) # returns an equation
        print(answer) # returns the answer to the equation above
        
        ```
        
        ## Equation Class Properties
        The `algebraMathGenerator.generateAlgebraEquation()` has many properties.
        
        `algebraMathGenerator.generateAlgebraEquation()` properties:
        
        > .equation
        > .variable
        > .operation
        > .equalsTo
        > .coeffecient
        > .constant
        
        
        You can even loop through the generate method to produce a bunch of equations and their answers!
