Description: HeatshrinkPy
        ============
        
        Compression using the `Heatshrink algorithm
        <https://github.com/atomicobject/heatshrink>`__ in Python 3.
        
        This library is a pure Python rewrite and a drop-in replacenment of `heatshrink2 <https://github.com/eerimoq/pyheatshrink>`__ library.
        
        It is significantly slower than the native one. It can be used as a fallback if building a native extension is not an
        option.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        From PyPI:

           $ pip install heatshrinkpy
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Please refer to the `heatshrink2 <https://github.com/eerimoq/pyheatshrink>`__ library for usage and documentation -
        just replace heatshrink2 with heatshrinkpy where applicable.
