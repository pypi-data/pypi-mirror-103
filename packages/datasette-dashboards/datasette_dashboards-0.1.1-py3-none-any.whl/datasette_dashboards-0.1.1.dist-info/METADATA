**WARNING**: this is a highly experimental work serving as exploration and
proof-of-concept. This could become a plugin in the long run if something
interesting comes up!

## Installation

Install this plugin in the same environment as Datasette:

```bash
$ datasette install datasette-dashboards
```

## Usage

Define dashboards within `metadata.yml` / `metadata.json`:

```yaml
plugins:
  datasette-dashboards:
    my_dashboard:
      title: My Dashboard
      description: Showing some nice metrics
      charts:
        - title: Number of events by day
          db: jobs
          query: SELECT date(date) as day, count(*) as count FROM events GROUP BY day ORDER BY day
          library: vega
          display:
            mark: { type: line, tooltip: true }
            encoding:
              x: { field: day, type: temporal }
              y: { field: count, type: quantitative }
        - title: Number of events by source
          db: jobs
          query: SELECT source, count(*) as count FROM events GROUP BY source ORDER BY count DESC
          library: vega
          display:
            mark: { type: bar, tooltip: true }
            encoding:
              color: { field: source, type: nominal }
              theta: { field: count, type: quantitative }
```

To display [Vega](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/docs/) charts:

- `library` must be set to `vega`
- `display` is a valid Vega specification object:
  - Some fields are pre-defined: `$schema`, `title`, `width`, `view`, `config`, `data`
  - All fields are passed along as-is (overriding pre-defined fields if any)
  - Only `mark` and `encoding` fields are required as the bare-minimum

A new menu entry is now available, pointing at `/-/dashboards` to access all defined dashboards.

## Development

To set up this plugin locally, first checkout the code.
Then create a new virtual environment and the required dependencies:

```bash
pipenv install -d
pipenv shell
```

To run the tests:

```bash
pytest
```

## Demo

With the developmnent environment setup, you can run the demo locally:

```bash
datasette --metadata demo/metadata.yml demo/jobs.db
```
