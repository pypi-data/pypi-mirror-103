# Autonomous Bariloche Central DAQ

## concept

The main concept for the DAQ is that it orbits around a central server. Control and information run through this server allowing a permanent follow-up of what is happening. The raw data is handled by the clients themselves and is not seen by the DAQ.
The central server is a MQTT broker. We recommend using mosquitto.

## code

All the code is in the libABCD directory.
Example applications are in the examples directory. They include:
* S.py, a "spy" application that requests all messages being exchanged in the system and logs them
* exec-client.py, an example application that runs commands sent to it (warning, this is a huge security risk, do not run in unprotected environment)
* run.py, a run controller app that looks at an experiment description in a JSON file and runs the programs in screens and restarts them in case they die (includes the experiment.json example of JSON file)
* send.py, a simple message sender

Running the examples can be done by launching run.py experiment, and using send.py to see what happens, for example with _./send.py '{"to":"client1","cmd":"exec","py":"print(1)"}'_ which should have client1 print 1. Running S.py manually can also be interesting to see all messages going through. Mosquitto should be run at a system level.
